Challenges we ran into
ENS RPC call requests getting blocked reason being the limited rate,

-Vercelâ€™s 64KB Environment Variables limit was exhausted we had to find a workaround,
-NPM e-integrity error,
-Integrating the different modules of the Huddle SDK with the custom Firebase Cloud Function took some time,

-Took a hefty time for enabling Push notifications the documentation was not quite descriptive,
